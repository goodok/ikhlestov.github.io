One-shot learning
    aim to lean not from thousands of examples but from one or only a few.

Transfer learning
    apply already trained model with previous knowledge to the new domain.

MLP
    is an abbreviation for *multilayer perceptrons*  

Computational neuroscience
    is primarily concerned with building more accurate models of how the brain actually works.

Stochastic(non-determenistic)
    a stochastic event or system is one that is unpredictable because of a random variable. 

Determenstic
    is a system in which no randomness is involved in the development of future states of the system. 

Gradient
    is the vector of partial derivatives in each dimension.

Gradient Descent
    the procedure of repeatedly evaluating the gradient and then performing a parameter update.

Stochastic Gradient Descent
    depends on source it may mean Gradient Descent with batches, or with only one example(on-line gradient descent).

Backpropagation
    computing the gradient analytically using the chain rule.
